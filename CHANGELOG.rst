0.8.0
======
**(2023-07-23)**

Breaking Change
----------------
Python 2 hosts are no longer supported. For NeoVim, 3.7 or later is required.

Changed
-------
- the ``:CPYwrite`` command will try to add an ``@author`` tag to
  existing JavaDoc comments above the main class in Java files
- comment headers in Pascal files are now enclosed by ``(*...*)``

Added
-----
- new option, ``g:cpywrite#java#add_class_doc``, to (dis/en)able adding
  the ``@author`` tag to JavaDoc comments

0.7.0
======
**(2022-01-10)**

Fixed
-----
.. _fixes-in-070:

- copyright now appears in the correct place in GPL v1 and v2 license headers.
  Previously, an overly permissive regex would match the historical ZIP code of
  the Free Software Foundation (a regression dating from version `0.4.0`_ )
- makefiles and Dockerfiles with no extension are no longer treated as shell scripts
- generic dotfiles no longer match with Vim script
- running the ``cpywrite`` module as a script will not make a backup of newly created files
- new files generated by the ``cpywrite`` module will not be padded with null bytes
- unit tests no longer hang on neovim

Changed
-------
.. _changes-in-070:

- by default, executable script files no longer have their shebang lines replaced with a
  template. Setting ``g:cpywrite#preserve_shebangs`` to ``0`` restores the old behaviour
- the ``&syntax`` property is now always considered when detecting file type

Added
-----
- new ``:CPYwriteKeepShebangs`` command for setting ``g:cpywrite#preserve_shebangs``
- new supported file types:

  + Config
  + Dockerfile
  + (DOS) INI
  + Makefile
  + Properties
  + reStructuredText
  + Xresources (detected by ``&syntax``, i.e., works in vim sessions only)
  + YAML

**Note.**

Typical make- and Dockerfiles with no extension will be prepended with bash-style
``#`` comments as before, *without* a shebang line (see `above <#fixes-in-070>`_).

Makefile extensions ``.mk`` and ``.mak`` will also match the Make file type; the
``.dockerfile`` extension matches the Dockerfile type.

.. _`0.4.0`: https://github.com/rdipardo/vim-cpywrite/commit/d657a99672dc0d1cafc51444cd730203b82baf7f

0.6.0
======
**(2021-10-01)**

Fixed
-----
- prevent authorship regex from matching publication dates in the verbatim text
  of the Apache 2.0, GD and X11 licenses
- running the ``cpywrite`` module as a Python script will not overwrite
  existing files

Added
-----
- new ``g:cpywrite#machine_readable`` option to format license and copyright as
  tags; can be set with ``:CPYwriteToggleStyle``
- new ``g:cpywrite#no_anonymous`` option to always state the copyright holder
  above Public Domain licenses; can be set with ``:CPYwriteAllowAnonymous``
- support for DOS Batch files

0.5.0
======
**(2021-07-03)**

Fixed
-----
- fallback to a system user name if no git email exists

Changed
-------
- preserve existing markup, encoding and doctype declarations at the top of
  XML, HTML or PHP files

Added
-----
- support for these file types:

  + Julia
  + Prolog (detected by ``&syntax`` when the extension is ``*.pl``)
  + XML

0.4.0
======
**(2021-05-24)**

Fixed
-----
- include user's email in the ECL-1.0 header

Changed
-------
- the initial value of ``g:cpywrite#default_license`` is now ``'Apache-2.0'``
- drop the `deprecated FreeBSD variant`_ of the BSD 2-Clause License
- detect more styles of authorship template, like a generic range of years
  (e.g. ``<yyyy, yyyy>``), or an actual year that's merely historical
  (e.g. copyright notice of the 0BSD). The old matching rules are retained
  for the licenses that need them (e.g. the GFDLs, the ECLs,
  `the older GPLs <#fixes-in-070>`_, etc.)

.. _deprecated FreeBSD variant: https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause-FreeBSD

Added
-----
- include recent additions to the `SPDX License List`_

.. _SPDX License List: https://spdx.org/licenses

0.3.4
======
**(2021-04-04)**

Fixed
-----
- prevent copyright year regex from accidentally matching older versions of the
  Mozilla Public License
- don't throw an exception if the full name of a license doesn't start with *The*
- don't print angle brackets when ``user.email`` is empty

Changed
-------
- try to detect the user's interpreter program when modifying a shell script
- remove example GIF from plugin assets and use a hyperlink instead

0.3.3
======
**(2021-03-08)**

Fixed
-----
- (temporarily) request *ALL* full text licenses from the `previous release versions`_
  (with the exception of the `Unlicense`_ and `BSD-1-Clause`_ as before). A future
  release will probably start using a different repository when these versions
  fall too far behind the officially recognized templates
- minor refactoring of some redundant code

.. _previous release versions: https://github.com/spdx/license-list-data/releases/tag/v3.11

0.3.2
======
**(2020-12-28)**

Fixed
-----
- replace double-quotes with single-quotes when filetypes use ``"`` as their
  comment delimiter (i.e. VimL, Smalltalk)
- (temporarily) avoid requesting defective copies of the full `Unlicense`_ and
  `BSD-1-Clause`_
- minor pruning of some unreachable code (overlooked in `last release`_)

.. _last release: https://github.com/rdipardo/vim-cpywrite/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst#031

Added
-----
- match the ``.mkd`` extension with Markdown files
- support for these file types:

  + Eiffel
  + PureScript
  + R
  + ReasonML
  + Smalltalk
  + Vala

0.3.1
======
**(2020-10-26)**

Changed
-------
- use reStructuredText in project documentation

Fixed
-----
- call ``re.escape()`` on emails when searching authorship templates in case
  they contain regex symbols, e.g. ``00000000+some1@users.noreply.github.com``


0.3.0
======
**(2020-10-12)**

Changed
-------
- options that were prefixed with ``cpywrite_`` now start with ``cpywrite#``;
  this will allow future options to be loaded from the ``autoload`` directory

- licenses are now identified by full name when there's no standard header

.. _configure vim to wrap lines:

**Note.** To keep longer names like (e.g.) the ``LGPLvX.X`` from running off
the screen, enable line wrapping in your ``vimrc`` or ``init.vim``:

.. code-block:: vim

    set lbr
    set tw=500 "break after 500 characters
    set wrap "wrap lines

Added
-----
- HTTP responses are now `cached`_ in the user's temp directory
- the option to hide the current buffer's name in license headers by setting
  ``g:cpywrite#hide_filename`` to a non-zero value
- a ``:CPYwriteToggleFilename`` command for setting the above option
- detect ``.vimrc``, ``.gvim``, ``.ideavim`` and ``.exrc`` as Vim files
- support for these file types:

  + D
  + Edn (.edn)
  + Fennel
  + Markdown
  + ReactJS (.jsx) and ES Module (.mjs)
  + Scala
  + Swift


0.2.1
=====
**(2020-08-16)**

Fixed
-----
- improve load time of ``autoload/cpywrite.vim``
- refactor regex that was inserting authorship at random places in full
  license text

Added
-----
- recognize ``.vimrc`` as VimL
- prevent copyright notice for appearing on public domain (i.e. copyright-free)
  licenses, in both modes
- leave one blank line after header
- support for these file types:

  + Ada
  + Assembler
  + Coffescript
  + Elixir
  + Elm
  + Erlang
  + Kotlin
  + Lua
  + Objective-C
  + Pascal


0.2.0
=====
**(2020-08-13)**

Fixed
-----
- extract feature tests and core functions to ``autoload`` directory to improve
  startup time (`#2`_)

Added
-----
- document suggestion to use `set wildmenu`_  for faster completions when not
  using neovim

.. _`set wildmenu`: README.rst#completions


0.1.1
=====
**(2020-07-25)**

Fixed
-----
- brief notices are now fully capitalized
- better-looking standard headers for the older GPL and GFDL licenses families

Added
-----
- convenience commands for getting/setting global options:

  + ``:CPYwriteDefaultLicense`` -- supports ``<tab>`` completion
  + ``:CPYwriteToggleMode`` -- switches ``g:cpywrite#verbatim_mode`` on/off

- relaxed file naming rules to accept full paths
- recognize *CMakeLists* files with the ``.txt`` extension
- apply line wrapping to keep standard headers within 80 chars (you should
  still `configure vim to wrap lines`_ for best results)


0.1.0
=====
**(2020-06-18)**

- initial release
